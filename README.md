# quiz-maker
This is my code for a quiz management application. The application should allow users to create quizzes, take quizzes, and view their quiz scores.
It will have the following functionalitites-
User Management:
Allow users to register and log in to the system.
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain features.

Quiz Creation:
Allow registered users to create quizzes by providing the quiz title, questions, and multiple-choice options.
Store the quiz data in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for persistence.

Quiz Taking:
Allow registered users to select and take quizzes.
Randomly present the quiz questions to the user.
Features like navigation (enabled/disabled are implemented).
Track the user's answers and calculate their score based on the correct answers.

Score Tracking:
Store and display the user's quiz scores.
Provide a leaderboard to show the top scores achieved by users.

API Endpoints:
Design and implement RESTful API endpoints to handle user registration, login, quiz creation, quiz taking, and score retrieval.

Documentation:
Documents of the API endpoints, their inputs, and outputs.
